## 💻 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**

   npm run dev
   ```

3. **View the app:**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors
The template currently uses the Tailwind `indigo` palette for primary actions and `zinc` for neutral backgrounds. To seamlessly switch to your brand's primary color, you can selectively find-and-replace `indigo` in the component files with your preferred Tailwind color (e.g., `blue`, `emerald`, `violet`).

### Typography
Font settings are globally managed. You can configure the primary fonts by modifying `src/fonts.ts` using [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize your local or Google fonts.

## 📜 Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` - Builds the application for production.
